My compiler project for CS331 at Vassar.
This project implements a compiler for the Vascal language.


Written in Java 8, with JUnit 5 for testing and Gradle 5 as a build manager.


Lexer Notes:
The table mapping keywords to TokenTypes is in the Lexer class currently. It should be in the symbol table
but I haven't implemented that yet.
